    <p>My name is Brad Kerwin. I grew up in New England and I am studying to 
    become a software engineer. I discovered my interest on coding after
    seeing what my brother-in-law does for work combined with independent
    practice online. I chose to enroll in Coding Temple to pursue my dream.</p>
